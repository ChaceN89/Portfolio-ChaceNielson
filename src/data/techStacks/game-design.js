  longDescription: "From animated elements that make sites stand out to complex, data-driven applications with dynamic user interactions, I develop full stack solutions across the entire web stack. My work spans static homepages, RESTful APIs, and integrated platforms with external databases, user authentication, and modern deployment pipelines on AWS and Vercel. I focus on creating seamless experiences that are both functional and visually engaging.",
