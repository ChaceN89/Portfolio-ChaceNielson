export const geoPredictDescription = "A Full-Stack application for analysis of drilling data using large data files. Uses React Tables and the ChartJS Library. First project lead position."
export const geoPredictDescription_long = 
    <div className='space-y-2'>
        <p>
            I completed this application while working at the Energi Simulation Centre for Geothermal Systems Research at the University of Calgary. The primary objective was to develop an application for managing drilling data files for geothermal wells. The application is designed to handle security, user authentication, and the management of sensitive drilling data. Users can join organizations and share data among themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to providing dynamic real-time data visualizations, the application included a set of analysis tools that significantly enhanced drilling efficiency. These tools encompassed physics-based models and machine-learning modules. While I didn't personally create the analysis tools, I dedicated time to reviewing and integrating code authored by others into the web application.
        </p>
        <p>
            I assumed the role of project manager, which presented the opportunity to oversee a small team. My responsibilities involved task assignment, code reviews, as well as screening resumes, conducting interviews, and delivering presentations.
        </p>
        <p>
            The application has been utilized in drilling wells located in Germany, New Mexico, and Sweden.

export const portfolioDescription = "My portfolio website is made with React and Tailwind. It uses regular CSS for fade-in transitions and a few other sections. It is responsive and uses lots of modular code."

export const genrePredictionDescription = "A notebook using Apache Spark and Machine Learning to attempt to predict a songs genre based on text data."

export const aviarDescription = "Full stack photo sharing application using the MERN stack. Uses JWTs for authentication of user accounts. It was deployed on Heroku."
export const aviarDescription_long = "This application was completed as part of a Software Engineering class at the University of Calgary. It is a full stack application that utilizes  MongoDB database, ExpressJS backend and a React frontend. I learned a lot about CSS and React components.  Before Heroku changed their terms and conditions I had deployed the application there."

export const spaceSurviveDescription = "A video game based on asteroids. Includes multiple modes, power-ups, achievements, audio, save states and different enemy types."
export const spaceSurviveDescription_long = spaceSurviveDescription + " This game was originally taken from a simple tutorial that explain the basics of player movement and implementing enemies. After learning the basics of Unity game engine I decided to add my style and features to the game. I added enemies with different behaviours, game saving states, a game manager to control the level progress, music, sound effects, and more. While I stuck to the style from the original tutorial I made the game my own."

export const flappyBirdCloneDescription = "A clone of the phone game Flappy Bird, with difficulty progression and save states."

export const cubeGameDescription = "A simple game meant to explore how to create a game manager, level navigation, and endless game loops. Utilized Unity Physic Engine."

export const JengaDescription = "A virtual jenga game made in unity using a haptic stylus pen. The game features difficulty settings and haptic feedback."

export const voiceRecognitionDescription = "An application that allows users to record vocal profiles that can be tested against test audio using a Gaussian Mixture Model.";
export const voiceRecognitionLongDescription = voiceRecognitionDescription + " The application was originally a Jupyter Notebook showing the results of various speech models against different test audio files. It was later adapted into a Dash application to provide a user interface.";

export const capstoneDescription = "A physical device and Unity simulation designed for carbon dioxide separation using hydrostatic pressure.";
export const capstoneLongDescription = "This project was completed for my capstone project at the University of Calgary. 'Energy Storage and Direct Air Capture in the Deep Ocean,' explores innovative methods for carbon dioxide (CO2) separation from the atmosphere. By leveraging deep ocean hydrostatic pressure, we designed a physical prototype and a comprehensive Unity simulation. The prototype, tested in a pool environment, demonstrates the feasibility of CO2 condensation using pressure changes. The Unity simulation illustrates the integration of energy storage and CO2 separation systems, providing an interactive visualization of the device's operation and potential real-world applications. This project lays the groundwork for future advancements in sustainable energy and carbon capture technologies.";

export const musicPlayerDescription = "An online music player built with Vue, featuring a responsive design and theme selection."

export const imageProcessorDescription = "A frontend and backend application to queue tasks using multithreading. The application is for processing images which showcases the task management."

export const jobDashboardDescription = "A full-stack application to store, fetch, create, update and delete jobs."
