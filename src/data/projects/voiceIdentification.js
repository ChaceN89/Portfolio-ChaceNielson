    <p>
      This project involves the development of a voice identification system that uses machine learning algorithms to recognize and verify individuals based on their voice. Built using Python and Plotly-Dash, the system processes voice recordings and extracts features for analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project includes a comprehensive Jupyter notebook for data analysis and model training. It leverages various machine learning techniques to achieve high accuracy in voice recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The system is designed to be user-friendly, with a web interface for uploading and analyzing voice samples.
