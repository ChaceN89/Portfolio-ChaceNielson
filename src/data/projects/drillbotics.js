    <p>
      This project involved building a functional mini drill rig with the Drillbotics team at the University of Calgary. While I contributed to all aspects of the project, my primary responsibility was creating a graphical user interface (GUI) that could plot the drilling operation in real-time and provide interactive features.
    </p>
    <p>
      The GUI was developed using Plotly Dash and Python, offering a comprehensive and user-friendly interface to monitor and analyze the drilling process. The project showcases the integration of engineering principles with real-time data visualization, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of drilling operations.
