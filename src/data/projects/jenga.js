      This project involves creating a Haptic Jenga game using Unity and C#. The game leverages a haptic pen and OpenHaptics toolkit to provide a tactile feedback experience to the user.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game simulates the traditional Jenga game where users can interact with the blocks through the haptic pen, providing a realistic touch sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project demonstrates the integration of haptic technology with game development to enhance user experience.
