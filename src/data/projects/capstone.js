    <p>
      This capstone project, titled "Energy Storage and Direct Air Capture in the Deep Ocean," was conducted at the University of Calgary to explore innovative methods for atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> separation by leveraging deep ocean hydrostatic pressure. A secondary goal was to create a Unity simulation displaying the energy storage and CO<sub>2</sub> separation systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our team designed both a physical prototype and a comprehensive Unity simulation to validate and demonstrate the concept. The prototype was tested in a controlled pool environment, showcasing the device's potential.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Unity simulation further enhances this project by offering an interactive visualization of the energy storage system and its real-world applications. It allows users to explore the CO<sub>2</sub> separation process, the energy storage system, and the device's overall operation in detail.
