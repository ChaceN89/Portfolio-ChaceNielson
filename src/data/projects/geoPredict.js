    <p>
      GEO Predict is a full-stack web application that allows users to upload drilling data and analyze it using machine learning models. It is a prototype meant to test the feasibility of using machine learning models to predict drilling outcomes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The application is built using React, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL. The front-end is built using React and Tailwind CSS, and the back-end is built using FastAPI and PostgreSQL. The application is deployed using Docker and the University of Calgary Cloud Stack. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I completed this application while working at the Energi Simulation Centre for Geothermal Systems Research at the University of Calgary. The primary objective was to develop an application for managing drilling data files for geothermal wells. The application is designed to handle security, user authentication, and the management of sensitive drilling data. Users can join organizations and share data among themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      I assumed the role of project manager, which presented the opportunity to oversee a small team. My responsibilities involved task assignment, code reviews, as well as screening resumes, conducting interviews, and delivering presentations. The application has been utilized in drilling wells located in Germany, New Mexico, and Sweden.
