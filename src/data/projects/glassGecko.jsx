    <p>
      I designed and developed this homepage for the <BoldSpan>Glass Gecko Games</BoldSpan> team, using <BoldSpan>React</BoldSpan> and <BoldSpan>Tailwind CSS</BoldSpan>. It features <BoldSpan>Framer Motion</BoldSpan> animations and <BoldSpan>blurhash</BoldSpan>-based image loading for a smooth, visually polished experience that highlights both our <BoldSpan>games</BoldSpan> and <BoldSpan>team</BoldSpan>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project combines clean component architecture with a <BoldSpan>bright, playful design</BoldSpan>, delivering a modern UI that feels both polished and approachable. Built with <BoldSpan>reusable components</BoldSpan> and <BoldSpan>responsive layouts</BoldSpan>, and deployed via <BoldSpan>Netlify</BoldSpan> with <BoldSpan>continuous integration</BoldSpan>, it reflects my focus on user experience, maintainability, and performanceâ€”all while capturing the creative spirit of the studio.
