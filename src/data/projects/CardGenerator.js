    <p>
      Built for the Glass Gecko Games team to test card game mechanics before building a Unity game. The application allows users to generate a random playing card using artwork or their own custom images. It uses state management to keep track of the card data and the user's settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      It features a clean and responsive UI, with a simple design that allows users to easily generate a card and download an image. The application is deployed using Netlify.
