    <p>
      <span className="font-bold">Energy Tomorrow</span> is a 3D city-building simulation game where players take on the challenge of managing a city from an <span className="font-bold">energy perspective</span>. The game is developed using <span className="font-bold">Unity</span>, <span className="font-bold">Blender</span>, and <span className="font-bold">C#</span>, bringing an immersive and interactive experience to players.
    </p>
    <p>
      Players can design their city by placing components like <span className="font-bold">housing</span> and <span className="font-bold">roads</span>, while managing and upgrading <span className="font-bold">energy resources</span>. The game tracks critical metrics, including <span className="font-bold">energy output</span>, <span className="font-bold">energy consumption</span>, <span className="font-bold">city budget</span>, <span className="font-bold">pollution</span>, and <span className="font-bold">renewable energy percentage</span>, allowing players to see how their decisions impact the cityâ€™s growth and sustainability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently in its prototype phase, <span className="font-bold">Energy Tomorrow</span> aims to expand by incorporating <span className="font-bold">real-world data</span> for realistic city simulations. This feature will enable users to explore how energy solutions and infrastructure changes can impact actual cities.
