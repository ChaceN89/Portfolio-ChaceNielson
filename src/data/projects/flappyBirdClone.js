      This project is a clone of the popular Flappy Bird game, developed using Unity and C#. The game features similar mechanics where the player controls a bird to navigate through pipes without hitting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project demonstrates the use of Unity's physics and scripting capabilities to create a simple yet engaging game.
    </p>
    <p>
      It serves as an example of recreating a well-known game using modern game development tools.
