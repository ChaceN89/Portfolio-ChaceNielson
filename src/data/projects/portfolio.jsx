    <p>
      My portfolio highlight my tachnical skills and projects. It is built using React and Tailwind CSS. The portfolio features a clean and modern design, providing an overview of my work and contact information. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The project is deployed using Vercel, demonstrating the use of modern web technologies to create an effective personal branding website. Currently I am on the second version of my portfolio. 
    </p>
    <p>
      My orginal portfolio had too much extra information and lacked some features. The new version uses blurhashing to blur images on load and Framer Motion to create animations. It is more organized and has a more streamlined user experience to better showcase my work.
