# Personal Portfolio App - Chace Nielson

## Overview

This application serves as my personal portfolio, showcasing my projects and skills. It is built using React, Tailwind CSS, and regular CSS to create an interactive and visually appealing experience.

## Features

- **Animations:** The portfolio features animations to enhance the user experience and add a dynamic touch.
- **Project Showcase:** A section dedicated to showcasing my various projects with descriptions and links.
- **Photo Viewer:** Includes tools for viewing photos, providing a visually engaging way to display my work.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for styling.

## Deployment on GitHub Pages

To deploy the application on GitHub Pages, add the following line to the `package.json` file:

```json
"homepage": "https://ChaceN89.github.io/Portfolio-ChaceNielson",
